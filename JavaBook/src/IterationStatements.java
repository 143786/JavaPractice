/*   Java iterations ( loop )
Java iteration statements are for, while and do-while. These statements create what we commonly call loops /
A loop repeatedly executes the same set of instruction until a termination condition is met. Java has a loop
to fit any programming need.

1) while :
The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or block while its controlling
expression is true.
Here is its general for:

while(condition) {
// body loop
}

The condition can be any Boolean expression. The body of the loop will be executed as long as the
conditional expression is true. When condition become false, control passes to the next line of code
immediately following the loop.The curly braces are unnecessary if only a single statement is being
repeated.


// do-while :
If the conditional expression controlling a while loop is initially false, then the body of the loop will
not be executed at all. However, sometimes it is desirable to execute the body of a loop at least once, even
if the conditional expression is false to begin with.
In other words, there are times when you would like to test the termination expression at the end of the loop
rather than at the beginning.Furtunately, Java supplies a loop that does just that : the do-while.
The do-while loop always executes its body at least once, because its conditional expression is at the bottom
of the loop. its general form is :

do {
// body of loop
} while (condition);

each of iteration of the do-while loop first executes the body of the loop and then evaluates the conditional
expression. If this expression is true, the loop will repeat. Otherwise, the loop terminate.
 As with all of Java's loops, condition must be a Boolean expression. Here is an example :
